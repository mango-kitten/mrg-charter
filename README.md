# mrg-charter (Mangos Rhythm Game Charter)
A charting tool for MRG, a rhythm game I am designing in my spare time.
## How to use it?
pull the code down from the repository into vscode, and then run index.html. youll need to input a song mp3 and then you should be able to place notes. press the export button to save a .txt file. to get a song in the game, you need to give me both the .txt file and the mp3 you used.
the .txt file can also be imported into the editor (top right) and used to continue progress after losing the tab.
regular exports are highly encouraged!
